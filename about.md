subtitle: I help organizations accomplish more with data and technology. 
---

With each project I seek to understand the fundamental issues, whether
social, organizational, or technical, and find solutions that will last.

I currently work on strategy and impact at [Vizzuality](https://vizzuality.com).

In the past, I led data and digital project strategy as 
[World Resources Institute's](https://wri.org) 
Data for Impact Lead, where I managed the development of 
[Resource Watch](https://resourcewatch.org) 
and advised teams on product design, engineering, and
research methodology. I also worked on climate change and
water resoures modeling on the [Partnership for 
Resilience and Preparedness](https://prepdata.org), and
WRI's [Aqueduct](https://wri.org/aqueduct) Water Risk 
Atlas.
